[[Notebooks, ballpoint pens and books were the first requirements. Conrad’s Under Western Eyes and Mirror of the Sea, Ford Madox Ford’s Memories and Impressions, a handful of thrillers, Joseph Heller’s Good as Gold, Vintage Wodehouse. I was taking two cameras and I wanted to keep my money safe, so I bought a metal suitcase at some expense. It had a combination lock, and the salesman assured me it would take gelignite to open it if the lock was turned. It was heavy, so I took a light zip-fastened bag as well.]]

### Getting on


God knew where I would find myself from week to week, so I arranged with my bank to send money to certain places on my way where I could pick it up by producing my passport. I don’t like travelling with bundles of notes or even large numbers of traveller’s cheques. I bought a money belt, too, but in the end I used it only in the Sulu Sea, thinking that the pirates there might strip and search me without stopping to examine the back of an ordinary-looking belt. (The result of this subterfuge was that a number of banknotes were so damaged by salt water and sweat that for a long time in the Philippines I hesitated to try to pass them.)


### This is an H3 Heading

It was going to be wet at sea and possibly cold, so I took my old green Grenfell anorak from Vietnam days. I had thick-soled, strong shoes and a pair of lighter ones to wear ashore. Medicines: I bought Septrin, Mexaform (for diarrhoea) and aspirin. I washed out my father’s hip flask and filled it with Scotch. A newly acquired Polaroid camera was to prove almost as useful to me in breaking the ice with shy and hostile strangers as beads were to explorers of old.

## This is an H2 Heading

I couldn’t think of anything else.

At last I was ready for the traveller’s roulette to begin, and drove to London airport to catch the Athens flight.


There is no better place than a crowded European airport on an August morning in which to say a tearless farewell to air travel for a few months. With its look of a tarted-up transit camp, London airport stifles euphoria at the best of times. Even so, I felt none of the elation you might expect in an adventurer departing for Eastern seas among crowds of August holidaymakers morosely contemplating the big boards announcing delays in their flights to Vienna, Rome and Lisbon.

### Fernet

I had spent a late last night – reluctant, when it came to it, to abandon friends for a seagoing mystery tour almost half across the world on unscheduled ships. In thirty years of travel I have seldom begun a long journey without the feeling that I shall never return, and this beginning was no exception.
I edged my way to the bar and ordered a small black coffee. ‘Oh, and a Fernet Branca, please.’

‘Brave man,’ the barman said, and poured so generously that a small puddle of the dark-brown liquid formed around the base of the glass. I took his generosity as a good omen.

The Fernet Branca’s bitter warmth raised my spirits a notch or two. Soon a precise English female voice on the loudspeaker system announced that the Athens flight would leave on time, and this helped as well. But it was a false prophecy. Another two hours went by before we were allowed to board and listen to the captain apologizing for the delay, caused, he said, by air-traffic congestion. And another hour before the arrival of plastic trays bearing the airline’s ‘paprika sauce’ congealing on ‘turkey escalopes’ that retained the consistency of corrugated cardboard. The delays in the shipping world, I know now from experience, run into days or weeks, not hours, but only one out of the bizarre diversity of vessels I was to take on my long sea road to China produced food less appetizing than that airline meal between London and Athens.
I bought a cognac to wash away the taste and then the clear white Alps were below us. Later still, at last, the even clearer blue of Salamis Bay. Motorboats drew snowy trails among the islands and headlands basking in the warm sea. Seagulls wheeled and whitecaps flickered against the blue water – blue and white, the colours of the Greek flag. It was like a photograph on one of the postcards my fellow passengers would be sending home, whose recipients would sniff in disbelief at the unnaturalness of the colour reproduction. Here Europe ended; somewhere in the haze and glint of the eastern Mediterranean Sea, Europe and Asia came together. Beyond Athens airport the first of my ships waited for me; and, beyond that, Asia.
For the moment, Athens, much less Asia, was inaccessible beyond six long lines of passengers waiting for passport control. Evidently four jumbo jets had arrived at the same time.
A woman near me was saying, ‘It’s better at London airport, isn’t it? Better organized, really.’
I went through customs behind two florid young Englishmen dressed in identical brown blazers with brass buttons who bantered, Bertie Wooster-fashion, in strong Yorkshire accents.
‘To the yacht and straight into the sea, what?’
‘Yeah. Second one in pays for the champagne.’
‘Roger, old man.’
When I had reached the city centre and checked into a modest hotel on Mount Lyccabetos that someone had told me about, the receptionist told me I still had time to see Thomas Cook’s before they closed. I wanted to make sure I could get on the next ship heading through the Greek islands to Patmos. I had been told that the hotel had a ‘lovely view of the Acropolis’, and I suppose that if I’d been a giraffe I might have spent some time peering at it around the corner of the hotel. My room, though perfectly comfortable, was gloomy and on the ground floor and looked out onto a busy construction site. ‘It’s the month for the tourist groups,’ the receptionist explained. It occurred to me that perhaps all the passenger ships were going to be full too, so I hurried to Cook’s office in Constitution Square.
Cook’s was oddly hard to find but, after an interlude of dodging through crowds of blond tourists in shorts, I found it in a corner of the square on the second floor of a tall modern building. A friendly Greek lady there told me that the next ship to sail in the direction I wanted would be the steamer Alcheon, a Greek passenger vessel leaving Piraeus the next day at two o’clock in the afternoon for her regular run through the Aegean. She will stop, as usual, the lady said, at the island of Mikonos, and reach Patmos in the middle of the following night. Eleven hours; it seemed worthwhile to book a cabin.
